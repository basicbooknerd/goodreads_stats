I wouldn't classify this as science fiction. The book had some quantum physics concepts mentioned occasionally but nothing profound. <br/>I would have given this a higher rating if not for the ending. The kidnapper turns out to be his assistant Sheena who is an Indian woman arranged to marry a guy selected by her parents when she was 6 and she's in love with an American. In addition to that, her post doc research is not going anywhere. To overcome these obstacles, she devises an elaborate plan to drug and kidnap her advisor and falsely allege an another professor of sexual harassment. I think this plot is illogical and sexist. I find it hard to believe that this woman, who is extremely smart and has everyone fooled with her elaborate scheme, cannot find it in her to disobey/trick her parents or runaway from her familial situation and marry the ""love of her life"". <br/>Sexual harassment is a serious issue especially in academia and I think this book has trivialized it. Portraying Sheena to have falsely accused her professor of sexual harassment due to her lack of success is irresponsible on the part of the author because in our current society (moreso in Asian countries) women are not believed when they come forward and complain about sexual harassment/assault.",true,,1,,,0,,,,,
